## Introduction

Desktop application **made entirely in Unity*** with the purpose of being a final degree project. Focused on the **Algorithms for Videogames** subject, taught in the Videogame Design and Development Degree at the Rey Juan Carlos University, this application works as an **interactive tool for future students**.

The entire application is summarized in several interfaces where any student will be able to carry out a study of **the most used search algorithms**. Focusing from video games, it has been decided to choose a fairly common environment: **a maze**. In this way, viewing the execution of each one of the chosen search algorithms, every **user will be able to see how the exit from the maze is found** with the calculations within the code and in an image approach.

This type of tool have been a common application throughout the university degree, serving as **a great help with other types of environments or programming problems** . For this reason, we have sought to choose a tool that can be useful for subsequent generations of students, just as others have served for our promotion. With this, it is possible to unite interesting concepts such as **video games and programming**, encouraging students to continue investigating algorithms.

## Instructions

Being an application focused on interaction with the user and interfaces, it will be important to know the flow through them. For this reason it will be convenient to address each of the screens separately and in an orderly manner.

1- The first interface that can be seen when start the application is the logo, with the name of the application, and a button to go to the next interface.
