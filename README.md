## Introduction

Desktop application **made entirely in Unity*** with the purpose of being a final degree project. Focused on the **Algorithms for Videogames** subject, taught in the Videogame Design and Development Degree at the Rey Juan Carlos University, this application works as an **interactive tool for future students**.

The entire application is summarized in several interfaces where any student will be able to carry out a study of **the most used search algorithms**. Focusing from video games, it has been decided to choose a fairly common environment: **a maze**. In this way, viewing the execution of each one of the chosen search algorithms, every **user will be able to see how the exit from the maze is found** with the calculations within the code and in an image approach.

This type of tool have been a common application throughout the university degree, serving as **a great help with other types of environments or programming problems** . For this reason, we have sought to choose a tool that can be useful for subsequent generations of students, just as others have served for our promotion. With this, it is possible to unite interesting concepts such as **video games and programming**, encouraging students to continue investigating algorithms.
